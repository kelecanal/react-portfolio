# Hi there!
### My name is Kara
##### _Here's a little about me_

My favorite things in the world are two things. Elegant, precise things and puzzle games. 
I've worked for the restaurant industry as a pastry chef for close to 10 years now, and decided that it was high time to pursue a degree and a career in something that I want to do every day that involves both of my favorite things. This is why I've decided to create a portfolio site to showcase things that I've learned within the past year. 

I've included: 
* Bio
* Projects
* & Contact information!
